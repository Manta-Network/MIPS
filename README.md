# Manta Improvement Proposals 

MIP stands for Manta Improvement Proposal. A MIP is a design document providing information to the Manta community, or describing a new feature for Manta or its processes or environment. The MIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend MIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Manta. The MIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
