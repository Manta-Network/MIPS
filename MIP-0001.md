## Abstract

`MIP-0001` describes the MantaPay protocol. This is inteneded to be an "informal" treatment
of the protocol that optimizes readablilty. The formal treatment of the protocol can be 
found in this [eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/743).


## Primitives

* *zkSNARK*: public-verifiable preprocessing zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument 
of Knowledge. zkSNARK is a proof system that verifies computation expressed in a circuit. 
Given a field F, a zkSANRK for F-arithmetic circuit satisfablility is defined by a triple of 
polynomial algorithms (KeyGen, Prove, Verify)
    1. `KeyGen`(1<sup>&lambda;</sup>, `C`) &rarr; (`pk`, `vk`). Taken a security parameter 
    &lambda; (e.g. 128 bits) and a F-arithmeic circuit `C`, `KeyGen` samples a pair of keys, 
    namely a proving key `pk` and a verification key `vk`. (`pk`, `vk`) is usually referred 
    as the public parameter or common reference string (CRS).
    2. `Prove`(`pk`, `x`, `a`) &rarr; &pi;. Taken a proving key `pk`, public input `x`, and 
    witness `a` as input, the proving function `Prove` outputs a non-interactive 
    zero-knowledge proof of the designated statement defined by `C`.
    3. `Verify`(`vk`, `x`, &pi;) &rarr; {0, 1}. Taken a verification key `vk`, and a 
    zero-knowledge proof &pi;, `Verify` outputs 1 if the prover is convinced that `C` is
    true, outputs 0 otherwise.
