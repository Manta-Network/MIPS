## Abstract

`MIP-0001` describes the MantaPay protocol. This is inteneded to be an "informal" treatment
of the protocol that optimizes readablilty. The formal treatment of the protocol can be 
found in this [eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/743).


## Primitives

* *zkSNARK*: public-verifiable preprocessing zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument 
of Knowledge. zkSNARK is a proof system that verifies computation expressed in a circuit. 
Given a field F, a zkSANRK for F-arithmetic circuit satisfablility is defined by a triple of 
polynomial algorithms (KeyGen, Prove, Verify)
    1. KeyGen(1<sup>&lambda</sup>, C)
